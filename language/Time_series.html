<p>Much of the power of Pine Script™ stems from the fact that it is designed to process <em>time series</em> efficiently.
Time series are not a form or a type; they are the fundamental structure Pine Script™ uses to store the successive values of a variable over time,
where each value is tethered to a point in time. Since charts are composed of bars, each representing a particular point in time,
time series are the ideal data structure to work with values that may change with time.</p>
<p>The notion of time series is intimately linked to Pine Script™’s <a class="reference internal" href="Execution_model.html#pageexecutionmodel"><span class="std std-ref">execution model</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="Type_system.html#pagetypesystem"><span class="std std-ref">type system</span></a> concepts.
Understanding all three is key to making the most of the power of Pine Script™.</p>
<p>Take the built-in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_open">open</a> variable,
which contains the “open” price of each bar in the dataset, the <em>dataset</em> being all the bars on any given chart.
If your script is running on a 5min chart, then each value in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_open">open</a>
time series is the “open” price of the consecutive 5min chart bars.
When your script refers to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_open">open</a>,
it is referring to the “open” price of the bar the script is executing on. To refer to past values in a time series,
we use the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#op_[]">[]</a> history-referencing operator.
When a script is executing on a given bar, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open[1]</span></code> refers to the value of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_open">open</a>
time series on the previous bar.</p>
<p>While time series may remind programmers of arrays, they are totally different.
Pine Script™ does use an array data structure, but it is a completely different concept than a time series.</p>
<p>Time series in Pine Script™, combined with its special type of runtime engine and built-in functions,
are what makes it easy to compute the cumulative total of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_close">close</a>
values without using a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#op_for">for</a> loop, with only <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ta.cum(close)</span></code>.
This is possible because although <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ta.cum(close)</span></code> appears rather static in a script, it is in fact executed on each bar,
so its value becomes increasingly larger as the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_close">close</a>
value of each new bar is added to it. When the script reaches the rightmost bar of the chart,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ta.cum(close)</span></code> returns the sum of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_close">close</a> value from all bars on the chart.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mean of the difference between the last 14 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_high">high</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_low">low</a> values can be expressed as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ta.sma(high</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">low,</span> <span class="pre">14)</span></code>,
or the distance in bars since the last time the chart made five consecutive higher highs as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">barssince(rising(high,</span> <span class="pre">5))</span></code>.</p>
<p>Even the result of function calls on successive bars leaves a trace of values in a time series that can be referenced using the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#op_[]">[]</a> history-referencing operator.
This can be useful, for example, when testing the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_close">close</a>
of the current bar for a breach of the highest <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_high">high</a>
in the last 10 bars, but excluding the current bar, which we could write as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">breach</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">close</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">highest(close,</span> <span class="pre">10)[1]</span></code>.
The same statement could also be written as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">breach</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">close</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">highest(close[1],</span> <span class="pre">10)</span></code>.</p>
<p>The same looping logic on all bars is applied to function calls such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plot(open)</span></code>
which will repeat on each bar, successively plotting on the chart the value of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_high">open</a>
for each bar.</p>
<p>Do not confuse “time series” with the “series” form.
The <em>time series</em> concept explains how consecutive values of variables are stored in Pine Script™; the “series” form denotes variables whose values can change bar to bar.
Consider, for example, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_timeframe{dot}period">timeframe.period</a>
built-in variable which is of form “simple” and type “string”, so “simple string”.
The “simple” form entails that the variable’s value is known on bar zero (the first bar where the script executes)
and will not change during the script’s execution on all the chart’s bars. The variable’s value is the chart’s timeframe in string format,
so <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">"D"</span></code> for a 1D chart, for example. Even though its value cannot change during the script,
it would be syntactically correct in Pine Script™ (though not very useful) to refer to its value 10 bars ago using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">timeframe.period[10]</span></code>.
This is possible because the successive values of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_timeframe{dot}period">timeframe.period</a>
for each bar are stored in a time series, even though all the values in that particular time series are similar.
Note, however, that when the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#op_[]">[]</a> operator is used to access past values of a variable,
it yields a result of “series” form, even though the variable without an offset is of another form,
such as “simple” in the case of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_timeframe{dot}period">timeframe.period</a>.</p>
<p>When you grasp how time series can be efficiently handled using Pine Script™’s syntax and its <a class="reference internal" href="Execution_model.html#pageexecutionmodel"><span class="std std-ref">execution model</span></a>,
you can define complex calculations using little code.</p>
